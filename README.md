# URL_Shortener
URL shortening is a technique in which a URL may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo". 

A friendly URL may be  • desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters in a message (for example SMS). • for reducing the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source. •  for making it easier for a person to remember. • And many more..
